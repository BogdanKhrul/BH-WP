                I am a <span className={css.span}>Full-Stack Web Developer</span> who turns ideas into working
                solutions. I work on both frontend and backend, creating simple and effective applications. My approach
                is quality code, attention to detail and striving for perfection in every project. I donâ€™t just write
                code, I solve problems. If you are looking for a developer who is not afraid of new challenges - I am
                your man.
