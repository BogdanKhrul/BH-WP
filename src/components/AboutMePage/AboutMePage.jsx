                <p>Hello, I'm Bohdan Khrul</p>
                <p>
                    I am a Full-Stack Web Developer who has been developing for two years and I turn ideas into working
                    solutions. I work on both Frontend and Backend, creating simple and effective applications. My
                    approach is quality code, attention to detail and striving for perfection in every project. I donâ€™t
                    just write code, I solve problems. If you are looking for a developer who is not afraid of new
                    challenges - I am your man.
                </p>
